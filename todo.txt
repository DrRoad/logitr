- Add support for MXL models that also have fixed parameters
- Consider going back to using optim rather than nloptr (automatically gets
  hessian at solution, plus it's in base R). Might be slightly slower.
- Get rid of data.table usage, and consider avoiding dplyr (test speed
  difference).

- Add infinite loop stopper in multistart run
- Consider removing the requirement for using the data.table package (use rowsums?).
- Add support for adding weights to model.
- Make plot of search space with all multistarts
- The current MXL analytic gradients are not very efficient (they have loops).
  Need to revise them for efficiency.
- The gradient for WTP space is still incorrect (the 'mxlNegGradLL' function).
  As a result, the option for 'useAnalyticGrad' is overridden in this version
  when estimating a WTP space MXL model. Gradients are instead numerically
  approximated.
