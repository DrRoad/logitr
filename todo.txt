- Make a wtp.logitr() function that computes wtp from a prefSpaceModel
- Remove the prefSpaceModel option and add a wtpCompare(prefModel, wtpModel) function
- Add option to include starting points for first run
- Add support for adding weights to model.
- Make plot of search space with all multistarts?
- The current MXL analytic gradients are not very efficient (they have loops).
  Maybe I can revise them for efficiency by using matrix operations?
- Consider adding support for latent class models
