- Update print level options to include printing of multistarts (default to 0, which is no printing)
- Add option to include a starting point for first run
- Make a logitr.wtp() function that computes wtp from a prefSpaceModel
- Remove the prefSpaceModel option and add a logitr.wtpComp(prefModel, wtpModel) function
- Update printing functions according to above changes
- Update summary function to do the summary calculations rather than do them during estimation
- Add support for adding weights to model.
- Make plot of search space with all multistarts?
- The current MXL analytic gradients are not very efficient (they have loops).
  Maybe I can revise them for efficiency by using matrix operations?
- Consider adding support for latent class models
