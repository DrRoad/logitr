- Update MXL parameter inputs (currently numbers, change to mlogit format)
- Add timer supper
- Add infinite loop stopper in multistart run
- Add support for adding weights to model.
- Make plot of search space with all multistarts?
- The current MXL analytic gradients are not very efficient (they have loops).
  Need to revise them for efficiency.
- The gradient for WTP space is still incorrect (the 'mxlNegGradLL' function).
  As a result, the option for 'useAnalyticGrad' is overridden in this version
  when estimating a WTP space MXL model. Gradients are instead numerically
  approximated.
