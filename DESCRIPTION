Description: logitr estimates multinomial (MNL) and mixed logit (MXL) models in R with options to estimate in the preference space or willingness-to-pay (WTP) spaces. The program includes an option to run a multistart optimization loop with random starting points to search for a global solution, which should be done for WTP space models as well as mixed logit models since they have nonlinear-in-parameters utility functions that may result in multiple local maxima. The main optimization loop uses the nloptr function to minimize the negative log-likelihood function.
